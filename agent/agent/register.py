"""NAT custom tool registration and workflow plugins.

Register tools with a **module-level call** after the function is defined::

    nat_tool(my_function, "my_function")

Do **not** use ``@nat_tool()`` as a decorator with no arguments; that raises
``TypeError: nat_tool() missing 2 required positional arguments: 'fn' and 'name'``.

Each tool name must also appear under ``functions`` in ``workflow.yaml`` and in
``workflow.tool_names``. See ``docs/agent/frameworks/nat.md``.

Framework-specific NAT plugins are loaded from datarobot-genai and NAT
entrypoints. When Mem0 is enabled, memory registration lives in
``agent.register_memory`` so it can be shared by every workflow template.
